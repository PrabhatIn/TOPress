## TOPress: a MATLAB implementation for topology optimization of structures subjected to design‑dependent pressure loads
`TOPress.m` provides a MATLAB implementation for topology optimization of structures subjected to design‑dependent pressure loads. Typically, a design-dependent load changes its direction, locationa and/or magnitude as topology optimization advances, and, thus, poses several unique challanges.
